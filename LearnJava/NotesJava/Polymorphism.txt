Class = 12

Polymorphism  = one thing can have many forms.

Shape = circle, square, rectangle etc ..
Water = vapour, ice burgs etc..

We can achieve polymorphism using overloading.

void m1();
void m2();
void m3();



4 rules for overloading

1 > Method names should be same.
2 > Number of parameters should be different.
3 > Data type of parameters should be different.
4 > Order of parameters should be different.


Use of overloading in java

addition of numbers > 

add(1, 2);
addThree(1, 2, 3);
addFour(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

add(1, 2);
add(1, 2, 3);
add(1, 2, 3, 4);
 

Encapsulation

wrapping up of data and methods in to single unit(Class).
Advantages = Security purpose.
by encapsulation we cannot access the variables of a class directly we can access by using members of same class(Setters and getters).

To achieve data hiding in java 
> Make the memebrs private 
> use setters and getters
