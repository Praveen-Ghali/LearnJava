	this and static keywords

Day =13

this keyword is used to differenciate the class and local variables.

types of variables 
1> class variables (instance variables)
2 > local variables 


static keyword > 

static keyword can apply for varaible and methods.

static variables
static methods 

non-static variables
non-static methods


Exp :





Emp - class > variables, id, name, > methods > bonus, login, work


Emp > can create multiple objects

through the object variable we can operaatee

to avoid code duplication make the member to static

problems to overcome by static keyword 
1> modification is difficult
2 > memory also wasted 

to solve the above problems 

1> assign the value to the particular variable 
2> make the variable to static
that variable is common to multiple object


1> static methods can access static stuffs directly.
2> static methods can access non-static stuffs through the objects.
3> from non-static methods we can access non-static and static stuff directly.
4> if we have different class, need to access the static by using classname
5> for non-static we need to create object and clear 

question ?

class Test {
static String s = "welcome";
classname.s.length();


class System {


static PrintStream out;

}

System.out.println();

}

System > is a predefined class
out > is static variable of printStream class 
println >  is a method present in printStream class
}



JVM > always looks for the main method > 

starts execution
public static void main(String[] args ) {
 public > access modifer we can access where ever
 static = we can access directly without creating any object.
 void - main method will not return any value;
 String[] args - is the string arguments can take as a arguments
